Dear sb-admin-react Forker,

	Hi, my name is Steve Steiner, aka/ssteinerX, a fellow forker of the:

	https://github.com/start-react/sb-admin-react

	repository.

	I have made major progress in bringing everything up to date
(React 15.3.x and *all* other dependencies other than Babel and jQuery) and
wonder if you have any further interest in the project.

	If not, please just ignore this message and I apologize for any
inconvenience.

	If so, please check out my fork at:

		 https://github.com/ssteinerx/sb-admin-react

	Issues are open, pull requests gladly accepted.

Thanks,

Steve Steiner
